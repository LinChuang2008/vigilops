# MCP Protocol Meets Operations: What AI-Native Monitoring Looks Like

## A New Interface for Operations

For twenty years, the primary interface for monitoring has been the dashboard. You open Grafana, stare at graphs, spot anomalies, then switch to a terminal to investigate. The dashboard is a read-only window into your infrastructure — useful, but passive.

Something is shifting. With the emergence of MCP (Model Context Protocol), monitoring systems can now expose their capabilities as tools that AI agents can use directly. Instead of *you* reading dashboards and making decisions, an AI agent can query your monitoring data, analyze it, and take action — all through a standardized protocol.

This isn't about replacing dashboards. It's about adding a new interface layer: one designed for AI agents rather than human eyeballs.

## What Is MCP?

MCP is an open protocol proposed by Anthropic for connecting AI models to external tools. Think of it as a standardized API contract between AI agents (MCP clients) and tools (MCP servers).

Before MCP, every AI application that wanted to interact with an external system needed custom integration code. MCP standardizes this: tool providers implement an MCP Server that describes available capabilities, and AI agents connect as MCP Clients that can discover and invoke those capabilities.

The protocol defines:
- **Tool discovery** — What tools are available and what do they do?
- **Parameter schemas** — What inputs does each tool expect?
- **Invocation** — How to call a tool and get results
- **Result formatting** — How results are structured for the AI to understand

By early 2026, MCP has gained traction: Claude Desktop natively supports MCP clients, multiple AI platforms have adopted the protocol, and the open-source community has built hundreds of MCP servers for databases, file systems, APIs, and more.

## Why Operations Needs MCP

The traditional ops workflow is sequential and human-driven:

```
Open dashboard → Read metrics → Check logs → Form hypothesis
→ SSH into server → Run commands → Verify → Document
```

Every step requires context switching between tools. You go from Grafana to Kibana to the terminal to Slack to Confluence. Each tool has its own interface, its own query language, its own authentication.

MCP collapses this into a conversation:

```
You: "What's going on with the API server?"
AI Agent: [calls query_alerts] → [calls query_metrics] → [calls query_topology]
AI Agent: "API server latency spiked 20 minutes ago. It correlates with Redis
          connection exhaustion on redis-01. The topology shows API server
          depends on redis-01. Recommend executing connection_reset runbook."
You: "Go ahead."
AI Agent: [calls execute_runbook]
AI Agent: "Done. Connection pool reset. Latency is returning to normal."
```

The AI agent isn't smarter than you. But it's faster at gathering information from multiple sources and correlating them. And for routine operations, it can handle the entire loop.

## VigilOps MCP Server: 5 Tools

VigilOps includes a built-in MCP Server that exposes monitoring and remediation capabilities:

### 1. `query_alerts`

Query active and historical alerts with filters.

**Example usage by an AI agent:**
"Show me all critical alerts from the past 6 hours" → Returns alert list with timestamps, severity, affected hosts, and current status.

### 2. `query_metrics`

Access metrics data for any monitored host or service.

**Example usage:**
"What's the CPU trend on web-03 for the past 2 hours?" → Returns time-series data that the AI can analyze for trends, spikes, or anomalies.

### 3. `run_diagnosis`

Trigger an AI-powered diagnosis on a specific host or service.

**Example usage:**
"Diagnose why db-01 is slow" → Gathers metrics, logs, and topology context, runs DeepSeek analysis, returns root cause assessment and recommendations.

### 4. `execute_runbook`

Execute a specific runbook on a target host.

**Example usage:**
"Run disk_cleanup on web-03" → Checks safety preconditions, executes the runbook, returns results.

Note: Runbook execution respects the approval configuration. If manual approval is required, the tool returns a pending status.

### 5. `query_topology`

Query service dependency topology.

**Example usage:**
"What services depend on redis-01?" → Returns upstream and downstream dependencies, helping the AI understand blast radius.

## Setting It Up

### Connect an MCP Client to VigilOps

If you're using an MCP-compatible AI client (like Claude Desktop), add VigilOps as an MCP server:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "vigilops": {
      "url": "http://your-vigilops-server:8001/mcp",
      "description": "VigilOps monitoring and auto-remediation"
    }
  }
}
```

### Deploy VigilOps with MCP Enabled

The MCP server is enabled by default when you deploy VigilOps:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LinChuang2008/vigilops.git
cd vigilops
cp .env.example .env   # Add your DeepSeek API key
docker compose up -d
```

The MCP endpoint is available at `http://localhost:8001/mcp`.

### Try the Demo

Visit [http://139.196.210.68:3001](http://139.196.210.68:3001) (`demo@vigilops.io` / `demo123`) to see the MCP configuration and tool list in the UI.

## What MCP Changes for On-Call

The most immediate practical impact of MCP in operations is on-call experience.

**Today:** You get paged at 2 AM. You open your laptop, load Grafana, check alerts, SSH into servers, grep logs, try to figure out what's happening while half-awake. Takes 20-45 minutes.

**With MCP:** You get paged at 2 AM. You open your AI assistant on your phone. "What triggered the alert?" The AI queries VigilOps via MCP, gives you a summary with root cause analysis. "Can it be auto-fixed?" The AI checks if a runbook applies. "Yes, disk_cleanup would resolve this." "Do it." Done. Takes 2 minutes.

This isn't hypothetical — it's how MCP-connected monitoring works today. The limiting factor isn't the technology; it's building trust that the AI agent's analysis and actions are reliable enough for production.

## The Honest Limitations

**MCP is still young.** The protocol is evolving, client support is still expanding, and best practices are still being established. If you adopt MCP today, expect some rough edges.

**AI analysis isn't always right.** LLMs can hallucinate root causes that sound plausible but are wrong. VigilOps marks AI analysis as advisory, not authoritative. For auto-remediation, safety checks and approval workflows act as guardrails.

**Latency.** LLM-based analysis adds 5-15 seconds per query. For P0 incidents where seconds matter, direct human response is still faster. We skip AI analysis for the most critical alerts and notify humans immediately.

**Security considerations.** Exposing your monitoring system via MCP means thinking carefully about authentication, authorization, and what actions AI agents are allowed to take. VigilOps supports configurable permissions per MCP tool.

## Why This Matters Beyond VigilOps

Even if you don't use VigilOps, the MCP trend matters for the operations community:

**Monitoring tools should become AI-accessible.** If your monitoring system only has a human UI, it can't participate in the AI agent ecosystem. Exposing capabilities via MCP (or similar protocols) makes your data and actions available to any AI system.

**The "single pane of glass" might be a conversation.** Instead of building the perfect dashboard that shows everything, the future interface might be a conversational AI that can pull data from multiple sources on demand. MCP makes this possible without requiring every tool to know about every other tool.

**Operations knowledge becomes transferable.** When operational procedures are encoded as MCP tools and runbooks rather than tribal knowledge, they become accessible to AI agents and new team members alike.

## Looking Forward

We built VigilOps' MCP server because we believe monitoring tools need a new kind of interface — one designed for AI agents, not just human operators. This is early, and the implementation will improve over time.

The broader bet: within a few years, every serious operations tool will have an MCP interface (or equivalent). The monitoring data and operational actions that are currently locked behind proprietary UIs will become programmable building blocks for AI-driven operations.

Whether that future is realized by VigilOps or by other tools, we think it's worth building toward.
