# Open Source Monitoring in 2026: What's Changed and What Still Hurts

> VigilOps Team | February 2026

## The Stack Everyone Uses (and Complains About)

If you ask any DevOps engineer what they use for monitoring, the answer is almost always one of three things: Prometheus + Grafana, Datadog, or "something legacy we're trying to migrate off."

The Prometheus + Grafana combination has won the open-source monitoring war. Prometheus is a CNCF graduated project. Grafana Labs hit $400M ARR in 2025 at a $6 billion valuation. Almost every Kubernetes component ships with a `/metrics` endpoint in Prometheus format. It's the standard.

And yet, teams still struggle with it. Not because the tools are bad — they're excellent at what they do — but because "monitoring" has become a multi-tool assembly project that requires real operational investment.

A typical production monitoring setup in 2026 looks like:

- **Prometheus** for metrics collection and alerting rules
- **Grafana** for dashboards
- **AlertManager** for alert routing and silencing
- **Loki** for log aggregation
- **Tempo** for distributed tracing
- **Thanos** or **Mimir** for long-term storage and HA

That's six components to deploy, configure, upgrade, and troubleshoot. For a team of 20+ engineers with dedicated platform folks, this is manageable. For a team of 3-5, it's a second job.

## What's Changed: The AI Wave

The biggest shift in monitoring over the past 18 months is the injection of AI — specifically large language models — into operational workflows.

**Datadog** launched LLM Observability for monitoring AI agent applications, and has been adding AI-powered features across their platform. At $3.3 billion in 2025 revenue, they have the resources to integrate AI deeply.

**Grafana Labs** has been more measured, focusing on AI-assisted query building and anomaly detection within their existing stack.

**New Relic** offers AI-powered root cause analysis in their commercial platform.

But here's what's notable: **in the open-source world, AI-powered monitoring is essentially nonexistent.** Prometheus doesn't do AI analysis. Grafana doesn't auto-remediate. AlertManager doesn't understand context. The open-source monitoring stack remains firmly in the "detect and notify" paradigm.

This gap is why we built VigilOps — but more on that later. First, let's survey the landscape.

## The Players: What Each Does Best

### Prometheus + Grafana: The Standard

**Best at:** Metrics collection, flexible querying (PromQL), visualization, Kubernetes integration.

**The reality:** Prometheus is exceptional as a metrics engine. PromQL is powerful. Grafana dashboards are the best in class. But the "stack" nature of the solution means you're assembling and maintaining infrastructure, not just using a product.

**What's missing:** No AI capabilities. No remediation. The gap between "alert fires" and "problem gets fixed" is entirely filled by humans.

### Zabbix: The Veteran

**Best at:** Traditional infrastructure monitoring. SNMP, agents, network devices, bare metal. Template ecosystem for specific hardware and software.

**The reality:** Zabbix has been around since 1998 and still serves a massive installed base, particularly in enterprises with legacy infrastructure. It's comprehensive but feels dated compared to cloud-native alternatives.

**What's missing:** Cloud-native support is limited. No Kubernetes-native integration. No AI capabilities. The PHP-based architecture is showing its age.

### Nightingale (夜莺): The Rising Star

**Best at:** Being a Prometheus-compatible, all-in-one monitoring platform with Chinese language support and an active Chinese community.

**The reality:** Nightingale, incubated at Didi (the Chinese ride-hailing company) and hosted by CCF (China Computer Federation), has become the go-to open-source monitoring tool in China. 8,000+ GitHub stars, 1,000+ enterprise users. It essentially solves the "Prometheus + Grafana assembly" problem by bundling everything into one deployable unit.

**What's missing:** No AI analysis, no auto-remediation. Primarily metrics-focused — log and trace capabilities are limited compared to the full LGTM stack.

### Datadog: The Aggregator (Commercial)

**Best at:** Everything, if you can afford it. The most comprehensive observability platform, with 700+ integrations and an expanding AI feature set.

**The reality:** Datadog's business model — per-host, per-GB, per-feature pricing — means costs can spiral unpredictably. Small-to-medium teams regularly report bill shock. But the product itself is undeniably excellent.

**What's missing:** It's not open source, not self-hostable, and not cheap. For teams that need data sovereignty or have budget constraints, Datadog is out of reach.

## The Actual Gap: From Alert to Fix

Here's what struck us when surveying the landscape:

**Every tool is excellent at detection.** Prometheus, Grafana, Zabbix, Datadog — they all do a great job of collecting metrics, setting thresholds, and firing alerts.

**Almost no open-source tool helps with remediation.** When an alert fires, the typical workflow is still: human reads alert → human SSHs into server → human investigates → human fixes. The monitoring system's job ends at "I told you about it."

Commercial tools are starting to address this — PagerDuty's Process Automation, ServiceNow's auto-remediation, Datadog's Workflow Automation. But these are expensive, enterprise-oriented solutions.

In the open-source world, if you want auto-remediation, your options are:
1. Write your own scripts and wire them to AlertManager webhooks
2. Set up Ansible/Rundeck alongside your monitoring stack (another integration to maintain)
3. Use VigilOps (which is what we built, so take this recommendation with appropriate skepticism)

## Where VigilOps Fits

VigilOps is trying to be the first open-source monitoring platform that includes AI analysis and auto-remediation as core features, not add-ons.

**What it does:**
- Full-stack monitoring (servers, services, databases, logs)
- AI root cause analysis using DeepSeek LLM
- 6 built-in auto-remediation runbooks
- MCP Server for AI agent integration (5 tools)
- Service topology mapping
- Alert escalation with on-call management
- Docker Compose deployment

**Where it falls short (honestly):**
- 🔴 **Community:** Brand new project, tiny user base
- 🔴 **Scale:** Tested with < 50 hosts, single-node only
- 🔴 **Maturity:** Not battle-tested in large production environments
- 🔴 **Ecosystem:** Limited integrations compared to Prometheus/Grafana
- 🔴 **HA:** No built-in high availability

We're not positioning VigilOps as a replacement for Prometheus or Grafana. For teams that need proven, scalable metrics infrastructure, those tools are the right choice.

VigilOps is for teams who want to experiment with what comes *after* alerting — the AI analysis and automated response that the open-source world hasn't addressed yet.

## Trying It

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LinChuang2008/vigilops.git
cd vigilops
cp .env.example .env   # Add DeepSeek API key
docker compose up -d
# Open http://localhost:3001
```

## Looking Ahead

The monitoring industry is at an inflection point. The "detect and notify" era produced amazing tools (Prometheus, Grafana). The next era — "detect, analyze, and act" — is just beginning.

We think the key components of next-generation monitoring are:

1. **Context-aware analysis** — Using LLMs to understand *why* something happened, not just *that* it happened
2. **Automated remediation** — For predictable, scriptable issues, let the system fix them
3. **AI agent integration** — Via protocols like MCP, letting AI assistants interact with monitoring data programmatically

Whether VigilOps specifically succeeds at this is an open question — we're early. But the direction is inevitable. Monitoring systems that just show dashboards and send notifications will feel increasingly incomplete.
