**Category: Ideas**

---

Here's where VigilOps has been, where it's going, and how you can shape its future.

## ✅ Completed

### Phase 1-3: Core Platform (Feb 2026)
- Server & service monitoring with real-time WebSocket dashboard
- AI root cause analysis powered by DeepSeek
- Log collection, search, and real-time streaming
- Database monitoring (PostgreSQL, MySQL, Oracle)
- Smart alerting with metric, log keyword, and DB threshold rules
- 5-channel notifications (DingTalk, Feishu, WeCom, Email, Webhook)

### Phase 4: Auto-Remediation
- Remediation engine with 6 built-in runbooks
- AI diagnosis → safety check → auto-execute pipeline
- Approval workflow for critical operations

### Phase 5: Dashboard & Topology
- WebSocket real-time dashboard with health scoring
- Service topology with force-directed and hierarchical layouts
- AI-suggested service dependencies

### Phase 6: SLA Management
- Uptime SLO tracking
- Error budget calculation
- Violation detection and alerting

### Phase 7: Topology Overhaul
- Enhanced service categorization
- Improved layout and interaction

### Cycle 8: Multi-Server Topology
- Hierarchical drill-down across servers

## 🚧 In Progress

### Cycle 9: Multi-Instance Deployment
- One-click deployment scripts for new clients
- Service delivery tooling and onboarding workflow
- **Not** building multi-tenant SaaS — deploying dedicated instances per client

## 🔮 Future Directions

- 🌍 **Internationalization (i18n)** — Full multi-language support
- 📱 **Mobile-Friendly Dashboard** — Responsive design or native app
- 🐳 **Public Docker Registry** — Pre-built images on Docker Hub
- 🗺️ **Global Topology View** — L1 overview across all servers
- 📈 **Predictive Analytics** — ML-based failure prediction
- 🔗 **More Integrations** — Prometheus, Grafana, PagerDuty export
