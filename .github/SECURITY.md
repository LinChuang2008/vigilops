## Security Best Practices

When deploying VigilOps:

- **Change default credentials** (`admin` / `vigilops`) immediately
- Use HTTPS in production (reverse proxy with TLS)
- Keep your `.env` file secure and never commit it
- Restrict database ports (5432/6379) to internal networks
- Enable audit logging for compliance tracking
- Use Agent tokens with minimal required permissions
